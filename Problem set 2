- To help avoid data duplication, the 'special_subject' column has a unique constraint that makes sure no two student are recorded on the same favorite. By keeping separate favorite subject, this improves the database's accuracy. This enhances the overall usability for tracking and reporting by giving users confidence that the data represents distinct favorite subject occurrences.
