# My Programming Portfolio

welcome in my portfolio.this respository shows all I've learned using the PL/SQL even it is simple.It is tightly integrated with the Oracle database, making it easy to access and manipulate database data. I'm a beginner in this database but it is more simple bot like the other.

Through my studies, I have come to understand that PL/SQL combines the data manipulation capabilities of SQL with the procedural programming features of traditional languages.
PL/SQL is compiled into machine code, which can significantly improve the performance of database operations compared to interpreted languages.

If i you want to be easy the other activities, you need to have a basic understanding of SQL and programming concepts such as variables, data types, control structures, and functions.PL/SQL includes a comprehensive error handling mechanism that allows developers to handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to users.

PL/SQL, or Procedural Language/Structured Query Language, has been a significant area of my learning journey. It is a powerful language specifically designed for Oracle databases.
